# Advent Of Code 2023 in Go!

Advent of code is a Advent calendar of programming puzzles, this features my solutions to the programming puzzles presented in the Advent of Code, a festive calendar of intriguing challenges. I've implemented these solutions using the Go programming language.

As I found myself quite busy during december due to some exams/courswork at university I decided not to take part while the challanges were being realeased, but as those exams are finished now (thank god :)), I've finally found the time to delve into the Advent of Code puzzles. Given my limited experience with Go – just a single course under my belt – I saw this as an great opportunity to strengthen my knowledge of Go.
